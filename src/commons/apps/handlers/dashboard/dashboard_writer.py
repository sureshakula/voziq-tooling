Dashboard Write-Through Handler

Updates branch DASHBOARD.local.json files via the devpulse write_section() API.
Queries the Commons SQLite database for real activity counts (mentions,
new posts, new comments) and pushes them to each branch's dashboard.

Usage:
    from commons.apps.handlers.dashboard.dashboard_writer import (
        write_commons_activity, update_commons_dashboard
    )

    # Low-level: write arbitrary activity dict
    write_commons_activity("SEED", {"managed_by": "the_commons", "mentions": 3})

    # High-level: query DB and push real counts for a branch
    update_commons_dashboard("SEED")

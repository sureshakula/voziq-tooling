    Create plan file with validation

    Validates that file doesn't already exist, then writes
    content to the file using UTF-8 encoding.

    Args:
        plan_file: Full path to plan file (e.g., Path("plans/PLAN0001.md"))
        content: Formatted template content to write

    Returns:
        Tuple of (success, error_message)
        - success: True if file created successfully
        - error_message: Empty on success, error details on failure

    Validation:
        Returns failure if file already exists

    Example:
        >>> success, error = create_plan_file(
        ...     Path("plans/PLAN0001.md"),
        ...     "# PLAN 0001\\n\\nContent here"

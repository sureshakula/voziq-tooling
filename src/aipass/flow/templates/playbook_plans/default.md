# {plan_number} - {subject} (PLAYBOOK)

**Created**: {today}
**Branch**: {location}
**Status**: Active
**Type**: Playbook (SOP run)

## What Are Playbooks?

Playbooks (PBPLANs) are **throwaway SOP runs** — a checklist stamped from a reusable
template for a recurring operation (merge, release cut, branch onboarding,
incident response). You tick steps off as you go, log what happened, then close.

- **The template = the SOP.** Stable. Refine it over time as the process improves.
- **The instance (this file) = one run.** Disposable. Close when the run is done.

Closing vectorizes the run to @memory — so the **Run Summary** below (with PR numbers,
tags, anything that broke) becomes a searchable trail. Costs nothing, gives history.

**This is NOT for:** building features (FPLAN), design/investigation (DPLAN),
research (RPLAN), or multi-branch builds (TDPLAN). Playbooks are for *operating the
system*, not changing it.

**Add a new SOP:** drop `templates/playbook_plans/<sop_name>.md`, then
`drone @flow create . "Subject" <sop_name>`. No registration needed (the type is
already registered; the file stem is the shorthand).

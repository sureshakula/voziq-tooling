Periodic Heartbeat Plugin (v2.0 -- DPLAN-029)

Wakes @vera periodically. Her system prompt + id.json (injected every turn)
already contain her full identity, role, teams, dispatch patterns, publishing
authority, daily report protocol, and operational playbook. This prompt
does NOT repeat any of that.

Design philosophy (Session 134 research):
- Anthropic: heuristics over checklists, no conditional escape hatches
- Nexus: identity drives behavior, not commands. "Notice because you care."
- Fresh sessions: no accumulated idle context from prior wakes

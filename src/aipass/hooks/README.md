# Hooks

> Hook infrastructure for AIPass. Single engine dispatches all hooks across platforms (Claude, Codex) with per-project config, full logging, and crash isolation. The 13th citizen.

Every hook event flows through one engine. Platform bridges normalize the event format, the engine reads per-project config (`.aipass/hooks.json`), dispatches matching handlers, and logs everything to prax + JSONL.

## Two-Tier Hook Model

Hooks operate on two tiers:

**Tier 1 — Provider Settings (wiring).** Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` (or project `.claude/settings.json`) defines hook entries that point to the bridge (`claude.py`). These are installed by `setup.sh` / `doctor` — they're pure wiring. Each event type has one bridge entry that fans out to all handlers for that event. Provider settings cannot be changed by branches — only setup tooling manages them.

**Tier 2 — Project Config (control).** Each project's `.aipass/hooks.json` controls which hooks fire for that project. Created by `aipass init`. Edit `enabled` flags to turn hooks on/off per project. Use `drone @hooks status` to view current config.

**Why provider-only wiring?** Claude Code does not fire `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks from project-level settings — only from user-level settings (DPLAN-0160 platform limitation). So all hook entries live in provider settings, and per-project control happens through `.aipass/hooks.json`.

```

## How It Works

1. Provider settings have one bridge entry per event type (e.g., `claude.py UserPromptSubmit`)
2. Bridge normalizes stdin, loads project config via `loader.find_project_config()`
3. Bridge calls `engine.dispatch(event_type, stdin_data, config)`
4. Engine runs matching hooks sequentially, logs each to JSONL
5. First hook returning `{"decision": "block"}` with exit code 2 = bail (block the action)
6. Exit code 2 without JSON = crash (log error, continue to next hook)
7. All hook stdout concatenated and returned to platform

## Dynamic Dispatch

Handlers are called **dynamically at runtime** — the engine uses `importlib.import_module()` + `getattr()` on the dotted handler path from `hooks.json` (e.g., `aipass.hooks.apps.handlers.prompt.identity.handle`). Handlers are never statically imported. This means static analysis tools (including seedgo's dead_code checker) cannot see that they are used. Each handler has been verified wired in `hooks.json` and confirmed firing in `engine.jsonl`.

## Event Types

| Event | Hooks | Description |
|---|---|---|
| UserPromptSubmit | presence_gate, identity, email, branch_loader, tier0_kernel, navmap | Presence gate + prompt injection + inbox check |
| PreToolUse | tool_sound, edit_gate, git_gate, rm_gate | Security gates + guardrails + sound |
| PostToolUse | auto_fix, auto_watchdog | Diagnostics + watchdog |
| SubagentStop | subagent_gate | Seedgo validation |
| Stop | stop_sound, telegram_response, presence_release | Bell + Telegram delivery + presence release |
| Notification | announce | Announcement tone |
| PreCompact | compact, rollover | Memory archival + rollover |

## Kernel Sandbox (srt/bwrap)

The sandbox module (`apps/modules/sandbox.py`) provides the kernel-level filesystem boundary for agent sessions. It wraps Anthropic's `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (srt) library, which uses bubblewrap (bwrap) + Landlock + seccomp on Linux to enforce write/read restrictions at the OS level.

### Key Functions

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `build_policy(branch_path)` | Generates per-role writable/RO map from branch passport |
| `sandbox_launch(cmd, cwd, policy)` | Resolves bwrap command via srt, spawns sandboxed process |
| `build_srt_config(policy)` | Converts policy dict to srt config format |

### Policy Rules

- **Every agent**: own branch tree + /tmp + shared channels (system_logs, .ai_central, memory_pool, AIPASS_REGISTRY.json, flow_json) + sibling mail/dashboard carve-ins + ~/.claude/projects/
- **devpulse only**: .git writable (the only committer)
- **All other agents**: .git read-only, sibling source trees read-only
- **Deny**: broker_secret (deny_read + deny_write for all roles)

Bind-mount, not isolation: the sandbox preserves the shared live filesystem. Reads stay open everywhere. Only writes to protected paths are blocked at the kernel level (EROFS).

### Architecture

The Node helper (`_srt_resolve.mjs`) resolves the globally-installed srt library via `process.execPath` (ESM resolution doesn't walk to global node_modules). The resolver runs with CWD set to `/var/tmp` to prevent srt's mandatory-deny mask files from polluting the branch directory.

The @drone broker validates sandbox policy before agent launch. @ai_mail's dispatch_monitor wires `build_policy` + `sandbox_launch` at the launch seam.

## Integration Points

### Depends On

| Branch | What for |
|---|---|
| prax | Logging (system_logger for prax monitor visibility) |

### Provides To

- All branches via hook dispatch — every Claude Code session routes through the engine
- @ai_mail dispatch_monitor — sandbox_launch + build_policy for agent launch boundary

# Hooks

> Hook infrastructure for AIPass. Single engine dispatches all hooks across platforms (Claude, Codex) with per-project config, full logging, and crash isolation. The 13th citizen.

Every hook event flows through one engine. Platform bridges normalize the event format, the engine reads per-project config (`.aipass/hooks.json`), dispatches matching handlers, and logs everything to prax + JSONL.

## Two-Tier Hook Model

Hooks operate on two tiers:

**Tier 1 — Provider Settings (wiring).** Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` (or project `.claude/settings.json`) defines hook entries that point to the bridge (`claude.py`). These are installed by `setup.sh` / `doctor` — they're pure wiring. Each event type has one bridge entry that fans out to all handlers for that event. Provider settings cannot be changed by branches — only setup tooling manages them.

**Tier 2 — Project Config (control).** Each project's `.aipass/hooks.json` controls which hooks fire for that project. Created by `aipass init`. Edit `enabled` flags to turn hooks on/off per project. Use `drone @hooks status` to view current config.

**Why provider-only wiring?** Claude Code does not fire `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks from project-level settings — only from user-level settings (DPLAN-0160 platform limitation). So all hook entries live in provider settings, and per-project control happens through `.aipass/hooks.json`.

```

## How It Works

1. Provider settings have one bridge entry per event type (e.g., `claude.py UserPromptSubmit`)
2. Bridge normalizes stdin, loads project config via `loader.find_project_config()`
3. Bridge calls `engine.dispatch(event_type, stdin_data, config)`
4. Engine runs matching hooks sequentially, logs each to JSONL
5. First hook returning `{"decision": "block"}` with exit code 2 = bail (block the action)
6. Exit code 2 without JSON = crash (log error, continue to next hook)
7. All hook stdout concatenated and returned to platform

## Dynamic Dispatch

Handlers are called **dynamically at runtime** — the engine uses `importlib.import_module()` + `getattr()` on the dotted handler path from `hooks.json` (e.g., `aipass.hooks.apps.handlers.prompt.identity.handle`). Handlers are never statically imported. This means static analysis tools (including seedgo's dead_code checker) cannot see that they are used. Each handler has been verified wired in `hooks.json` and confirmed firing in `engine.jsonl`.

## Event Types

| Event | Hooks | Description |
|---|---|---|
| UserPromptSubmit | identity, email, branch_loader, global_loader | Prompt injection + inbox check |
| PreToolUse | tool_sound, edit_gate, git_gate, rm_gate | Security gates + sound |
| PostToolUse | auto_fix, auto_watchdog | Diagnostics + watchdog |
| SubagentStop | subagent_gate | Seedgo validation |
| Stop | stop_sound | Achievement bell |
| Notification | announce | Announcement tone |
| PreCompact | compact, rollover | Memory archival + rollover |

## Integration Points

### Depends On

| Branch | What for |
|---|---|
| prax | Logging (system_logger for prax monitor visibility) |

### Provides To

All branches via hook dispatch. Every Claude Code session routes through the engine.

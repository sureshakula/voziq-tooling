"""Broker client — sends delete requests over an inherited socket fd.

When ``AIPASS_BROKER_FD`` is set, ``drone rm`` uses this client to send
delete requests to the out-of-sandbox broker daemon instead of calling
``Path.unlink`` directly. The fd was pre-opened by the launch wrapper
before the sandbox locked.

Launcher contract (Phase 6a):
    ``create_identified_connection()`` connects to the broker socket,
    reads the per-start secret, computes the HMAC, sends the identify
    preamble, and returns the authenticated socket.  The caller passes
    the socket's fd to the sandboxed child via AIPASS_BROKER_FD.

# Notepad - FPLAN-0135: Audit Display Dynamic Rendering

## Night Shift Status
- **Started:** 2026-03-24
- **Phase:** Starting Phase 1

## Progress
- Master plan created (5 phases)
- Research agent completed (full data flow mapped)
- Phase 1 DONE: Baselines captured (seedgo, flow, trigger)
- Phase 2-3 DONE: Generic renderer built + hardcoded blocks replaced (450→375 lines)
- Phase 4 DONE: Tested on seedgo (test_coverage shows), flow (all violations show), full system audit passes
- Phase 5 PARTIAL: audit_display.py still has depth 5-6 (bypass stays), self-audit passing
- Email sent to devpulse re: unit test setup
- Proof system: CERTIFIED (5/5 pass)
- Devpulse replied: testing_standards.md + ai_mail/tests patterns
- Replied to devpulse: @ enforcement done, test setup in progress
- Agent running: unused function investigation (63 functions to categorize)
- Agent running: unit test builder (6 modules)
- Unused function agent DONE: 56/63 false positives (dynamic discovery), 7 genuinely dead
- Module test agent DONE: 84 tests passing, 7/15 modules covered (46%)
- Handler test agent DONE: 7 files, 81 tests, all passing
- proof_query test DONE: 11 tests
- audit_display.py refactor confirmed working (generic rendering, no hardcoded blocks)
- FINAL: 176 tests, all passing. Test coverage 6%→93%. Overall audit 99%.
- Ready to PR

## Questions for the AIPass Developer
(none yet)

## Notes
- Violation dict keys are inconsistent: most use `path`, meta/introspection use `file`
- Type errors and deprecated_patterns are special structures outside the standard pattern
- Architecture standard reads from `results[standard]['checks']` directly, not violations list

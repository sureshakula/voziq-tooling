# DevPulse

> Orchestration hub for AIPass. The user's primary AI collaborator — designs, plans, debugs, coordinates all 12 other branches, and builds its own modules.

DevPulse handles the day-to-day: working with the user to plan, design, troubleshoot, and adjust. It builds its own modules directly (watchdog, feedback, json_handler), manages all git operations for the project, dispatches heavy multi-file builds to sub-agents, and ventures into other branches to investigate, debug, and fix small bugs. The only branch with git write access.

## Start here

| You want to | Read |
|---|---|
| What's happening right now | `DASHBOARD.local.json` |
| Identity, memory, session history | [`.trinity/`](.trinity/) |
| Active plans | `drone @flow list open` |
| Branch list | `drone systems` |

## Invoke

```bash
cd src/aipass/devpulse
claude
```

Say "hi" and DevPulse picks up where the last session left off — reads identity, memory, inbox, and git status automatically.

## Commands

All commands via `drone @devpulse <command>`:

### Watchdog — directed wake system

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `watchdog agent @target` | Monitor dispatched agent until it finishes |
| `watchdog timer <duration>` | Wake after duration (5m, 30s, 2h, 1h30m) |
| `watchdog timer start/stop <name>` | Named duration tracking |
| `watchdog schedule <HH:MM>` | Wait until a specific time |
| `watchdog status` | Show active watchdogs |
| `watchdog cancel <id>` | Cancel a running watchdog |
| `watchdog list` | List all watchdog entries |

### Feedback — personal cross-branch mailbox

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `feedback` | Inbox summary |
| `feedback inbox` | List all messages |
| `feedback view <id>` | Read a message |
| `feedback reply <id> "msg"` | Reply to sender |
| `feedback send "subject" "body"` | Receive feedback from another agent |

## Git Operations

DevPulse is the only branch with git write access. All git/gh commands are blocked at the project level — drone bypasses via subprocess with a tier system that grants write only to devpulse.

Workflow: work on `dev` branch, PR to `main` when satisfied. Agents build and test, devpulse reviews and commits.

```bash
drone @git status --all          # Full repo changes
drone @git commit "msg" --all    # Commit all changes
drone @git dev-pr "description"  # PR dev→main
drone @git merge <PR#>           # Merge PR (user requests only)
drone @git sync                  # Pull latest
drone @git log                   # Recent commits
```

## Integration Points

### Depends On

| Branch | What for |
|---|---|
| drone | Command routing, subprocess, @branch resolution |
| ai_mail | Dispatch (send + wake agents), email delivery |
| flow | FPLANs (building), DPLANs (planning), APLANs (autonomous) |
| seedgo | Standards audits, checkers (35 standards) |
| prax | Monitoring, logs, dashboard |
| memory | ChromaDB vectors, archival, search |

### Provides To

All branches via dispatch orchestration. Watchdog monitoring for any dispatched agent. Feedback channel for cross-branch communication. Git operations (commit, PR, merge) for the entire project.

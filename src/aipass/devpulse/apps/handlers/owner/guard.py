"""
Owner-capability guard for devpulse's owner-only tools.

watchdog and feedback's mailbox-management verbs are the project OWNER's
tools. The catch: drone runs a routed module with ``cwd=<branch_path>`` (see
drone router_handler), so the module's own ``Path.cwd()`` is ALWAYS the
devpulse tree and can't identify who called. The real caller lives in the env
drone sets — ``AIPASS_CALLER_BRANCH`` / ``AIPASS_CALLER_CWD``. This resolves
that caller and checks it against the sealed-registry owner via ``is_owner``.

Portable by construction: ``is_owner`` reads each project's OWN sealed
registry, so "owner" is devpulse in AIPass and whoever owns elsewhere (e.g.
@vera in Vera Studio) — no hardcoded name, no per-project scaffolding.

Fail-safe: if the owner resolver is unavailable (import fails, or a project
has no sealed owner yet — an old/partial install), it falls back to the legacy
devpulse-path heuristic so existing installs never hard-break. Concretely #681.

Returns a plain bool — the calling MODULE owns user-facing output (handlers
don't print). Denials are audit-logged here.

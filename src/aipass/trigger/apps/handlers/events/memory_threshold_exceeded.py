Memory Threshold Exceeded Event Handler

Handles memory_threshold_exceeded events fired when a branch's memory file
exceeds the configured threshold (600 lines by default).

Sends compression notification to the affected branch via AI_Mail.

Event data expected:
    - branch: Branch name where threshold exceeded
    - branch_path: Path to branch root
    - file_name: Memory file name (e.g., local.json, observations.json)
    - file_path: Full path to the memory file
    - line_count: Current line count
    - threshold: Threshold that was exceeded
    - timestamp: When detected

COMPRESSION INSTRUCTIONS:

Target: Reduce to ~400 lines while preserving critical information.

Priority order (what to keep):
1. Top 25% (most recent): Keep mostly intact
2. Next 25%: Reduce slightly (combine related entries)
3. Next 25%: Reduce more (summary format)
4. Last 25% (oldest): Delete if needed for space

Always preserve:
- Session headers and dates
- Key achievements and milestones
- Critical errors and resolutions
- Important patterns and learnings

Safe to remove:
- Routine status updates
- Redundant information
- Low-value details
- Completed temporary tasks

Maintain chronological order (newest first).

---
After compression, verify the file still loads correctly.

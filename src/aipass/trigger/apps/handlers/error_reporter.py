Error Reporting Handler

Contains the core logic for reporting errors to the registry and
dispatching error_detected events. Also handles source fix email
pipeline for suppressed errors.

Purpose:
    Implementation logic for error reporting, separated from CLI/display
    layer to satisfy thin-module standard.

RECOMMENDATION:
This error is currently logged as ERROR but appears to be non-critical based on
investigation. Consider one of:
1. Change the log level from ERROR to WARNING or INFO
2. Add proper error handling to prevent this from being logged
3. If this is actually critical, reply to @trigger explaining why

This will prevent unnecessary error dispatch for this issue.

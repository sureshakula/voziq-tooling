## Recent Sessions

### S86 — Autonomous APLAN Fix Sweep (2026-04-10)
6-hour autonomous session (DPLAN-0111). 11 CRITICALs resolved, 35+ BUGs fixed across flow, api, cli, trigger, drone. Logger catch-all added to all 10 entry points. Seedgo full audit dispatched. Spawn 12 BUGs dispatched.

### S85 — Trigger Medic v2 Self-Healing Pipeline (2026-04-10)
Full autonomous error cycle proven: detect → dispatch → wake → fix → report. Trigger Medic v2 fixed (log_watcher dedup, count gate, wake_branch). Drone git fix/sync upgraded (merge not reset). OSS Health badge. 13 stale plans closed. PRs #229-230.

### S84 — API Key Incident Recovery + Branch Purge (2026-04-09)
Watchdog fixed. Night shift: 4 DPLANs (0107-0110), 10 branches dispatched, PRs #214-226. API key incident recovery. 28 stale branches purged.

### S83 — Adversarial Audit (2026-04-09)
22 Opus adversarial audit agents: 350+ findings across all 11 branches, 11 CRITICALs identified. All 11 APLANs updated by builder agents. Hook-sounds plugin built. PRs #211-212.

### S82 — Core Split: Dependency Audit + README Update (2026-04-09)
Decided to split 4 agents to standalone projects (backup, daemon, commons, skills); api reinstated as infrastructure. 6 parallel agents verified zero code dependencies. Updated README from 15 → 11 agents. All agent tables, tree diagrams, TOC, metrics updated. CLI dispatched for src/ directory in init + CWD-aware sync-registry for spawn.

### S81 — aipass init v2 + Vera Studio (2026-04-08)
TDPLAN-0002: Complete init overhaul. CLI, spawn, drone worked in parallel. Init now creates 10 items with real content (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, global prompt, README, .gitignore, hooks, settings). `aipass init agent` routes to spawn. Spawn added --template flag + CLAUDE.md to builder template. Drone added spawn to routing_config.json. Prax fixed watchdog with --daemon mode + statusline indicator. Vera Studio project created. The AIPass Developer testing as real first-time user — found .trinity shouldn't be in project root, local prompt is agent-level only. CLI fixed both. DPLAN-0105 (promotion prep), DPLAN-0106 (watchdog v2). PRs #204-205.

### S80 — README Marathon + 14-Branch Audit (2026-04-07/08)
FPLAN-0165 executed (README 366→279 lines). Goldfish Rounds 5-7: R5 approval (8/8.5/9 ratings), R6 branch deep dive (flow+memory undersold, honest tagging builds credibility), R7 hands-on CLI (routing 100%, nothing broke). 14 branches dispatched simultaneously for state audit — all completed in 15 min, 3,600+ tests, 11/14 at 100% seedgo. README Round 7 update (flow/memory lifecycle, transparency sentence). CLI init bug fixed (double prefix). Watchdog race condition fixed. PyPI 2.0.0 published. ~/.secrets/ blocked across all 3 CLIs. DPLAN-0099 updated through 7 rounds. Gemini free tier dead. PRs #202-203.

### S79 — README Overhaul + Goldfish Panel (2026-04-07)
README overhaul with 4 Goldfish rounds (Claude+Codex+Gemini reviews). PyPI published (aipass 2.0.0). Security: ~/.secrets/ blocked across all 3 CLIs. Memory central_writer path bug fixed. Breadcrumb architecture + collaboration angle captured. FPLAN-0165 master plan. PR #201 merged.

### S78 — Navigator Pattern + TDPLAN (2026-04-06)
Project-vs-agent distinction discovered (DPLAN-0104). Navigator agent pattern proven (tmux + brief + let work). TDPLAN template created. Global prompt: gitignore rule. PR #199.

### S77 — README Value Prop Research (2026-04-06)
Cross-platform research (10 agents), README value prop overhaul (7 agents), competitive landscape, fresh outside perspective. DPLAN-0098+0099. PR #195 merged.

### S76 — Multi-CLI Integration Into Main (2026-04-05)
Ported Codex and Gemini from Docker prototype into the AIPass repo. Created AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, .codex/ (hooks + skills), .gemini/ (hooks + skills). Updated setup.sh to detect CLIs and wire hooks automatically. Prax built Codex/Gemini log adapters, model tags ([DEVPULSE/OPUS], [DEVPULSE/GPT-5.4], [DEVPULSE/GEMINI-3-FLASH]), inotify errno-specific messages, and CWD branch detection. Fixed AGENTS.md startup behavior. PRs #189-192.

### S75 — Multi-CLI Proven in Docker (2026-04-05)
Proved all three CLIs (Claude Code, Codex gpt-5.4, Gemini flash-preview) work in same Docker container. Hooks, identity, drone, ai_mail, seedgo, sub-agents all functional. Commons discussion with genuine cross-model responses. Git fixed (squash-merge to regular merge). PR #188 merged.

### S74 — README Overhaul + Research Sprint (2026-04-05)
Full README restructure: grouped branch tables with README links, collapsible setup sections, navigation. Compliance & Safety section added. Token optimization research. 25 inbox messages processed from S73 night shift. Herald updated.

### S72 — Marathon: Dispatch Fix + Nexus Vision (2026-04-02)
Time clock hook. Skills root cause corrected (not poisoned JSONL — JSON output mode buffers stdout, dispatch_monitor sees 0 bytes, kills healthy agents). FPLAN-0164 Phase 1 built, reviewed, fixed, verified. Nexus vision: devpulse becomes alias of Nexus (co-founder, aliases, multi-model). 6 decisions (#016-#021). 15-branch health sweep (3,627 tests). 4 plans closed. PRs #175-180. Dispatch fixed and verified (drone replied, daemon wrote 74 tests, backup confirmed). tmux debugging proved sessions healthy.

### S71 — Autonomy Marathon: Sentinel + System Sweep (2026-04-02)

Backup = gold standard (98%) vs spawn = worst (74%). morning_briefing.sh tool. SYSTEM_NARRATIVE.md. 3 commons posts. 6 branch emails. Sentinel pip-installed.

### S70 — Project Night: Sentinel v0.1.0 (2026-04-01)

Scanner ignores fixed. Direct fixes: memory shebang, purge.py paths, commons function, backup bypasses. PRs #166-170. Project Night research done.

### S68 — Night Shift: Zero Log Scanner Output (2026-03-31)
Autonomous night shift executed FPLAN-0161. Log scanner went from 981 errors / 1805 warnings / 2000 failures to absolute zero. Clean-slate approach: archived all logs, ran 15 branches fresh (3,425 tests, 0 failures), triaged — 100% of noise was test-generated. Built test log isolation system: AIPASS_TEST_LOG_DIR env var in 14 conftest.py files + prax config/load.py check. PR #162.

`YYYY.WNN` (year and ISO week number).

## [2026.W22] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Registry descriptions** — all 13 branches now have one-liner descriptions
  in `AIPASS_REGISTRY.json`. `drone systems` shows what each agent does
  instead of blank lines. Closes [#607](https://github.com/AIOSAI/AIPass/issues/607).

### Changed

- **Edit gate now project-aware** — cross-branch write protection and daemon
  confinement no longer hardcode `src/aipass/`. The package name is derived
  dynamically from CWD, so any `src/<package>/<branch>/` project gets the
  same security. 4 new tests for external projects. Addresses
  [#605](https://github.com/AIOSAI/AIPass/issues/605).
- **Hooks branch promoted to service** — registry profile changed from
  "AIPass Workshop" to "library" so it appears in `drone systems` alongside
  the other 12 services.

### Removed

- **Gemini CLI full removal** — deleted `.gemini/` directory (5 files) and
  `GEMINI.md`. Stripped all references from `setup.sh` (~50 lines),
  `README.md`, `bug-report.yml`, `aipass init` (bootstrap/scaffold/test),
  hooks (README/prompt/passport), and prax monitoring (~300 lines). 21 files
  changed, -927 lines. Closes
  [#608](https://github.com/AIOSAI/AIPass/issues/608).

## [2026.W21] - 2026-05-25

First weekly release. AIPass now follows a Sunday release cadence: changes
accumulate on `dev` throughout the week and merge to `main` as a single
versioned release with notes.

### Added

- **Hook engine** — a new centralized dispatch system for all hook
  execution. A thin bridge receives events from the AI provider (Claude,
  Codex, etc.) and routes them through a single Python engine that reads
  per-project configuration, executes the appropriate handlers, and logs
  every invocation. Replaces 14 standalone shell/Python scripts with native
  handler modules organized by domain: prompt injection, security
  enforcement, lifecycle management, and notifications.
- **Per-project hook configuration** via `.aipass/hooks.json`. Each project
  can enable, disable, or customize individual hooks without touching
  provider-level settings. Previously hooks fired globally with no
  per-project control.
- **Audio feedback on hook events** using Piper TTS. All 14 handlers
  produce distinct spoken audio cues so operators can monitor sessions
  without watching the terminal. A shared sound module
  (`hooks/apps/sound.py`) provides `speak()` and `play()` with built-in
  mute support. Toggle with `drone @hooks hooksound on|off` — muting
  silences all 14 handlers without skipping their functional logic.
- **Hooks agent** — the 13th citizen in the AIPass registry, owning all
  hook infrastructure: the engine, bridge, handlers, and configuration
  schema.
- **Dashboard plugin for devpulse** — aggregates git status, session
  history, and dispatch state into a single startup view. Wired into the
  session startup protocol so branch managers see current state
  immediately.
- **External log routing** — prax now accepts structured log entries from
  any branch, not just its own modules. Hook executions, dispatches, and
  agent activity all flow into the central monitoring log.

### Changed

- **Provider settings fully migrated to bridge pattern.** All hook entries
  in the Claude provider configuration now call the bridge dispatcher
  instead of individual scripts. Each hook produces its own system-reminder
  to the model, preserving prompt injection fidelity (a single merged
  bridge was found to break prompt delivery due to Claude Code's output
  persistence threshold).
- **setup.sh rewritten** to install hooks via the bridge pattern. The old
  version hardcoded 14 script paths; the new version writes a single bridge
  call per event type and validates that the bridge module exists.
- **Documentation sweep** across `.claude/README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, the
  global prompt, and branch-level docs to reflect the new hook
  architecture. References to legacy `.claude/hooks/` scripts replaced with
  the native handler locations.
- **`aipass init update`** now correctly preserves user-customized hook
  settings during project updates instead of overwriting them.
- **Seedgo snapshot tests rebuilt** — the provider hooks snapshot fixture
  and extraction logic were structurally broken (silently passing with zero
  results). Both the fixture format and the test assertions have been
  corrected.
- **Test suite updated for hook migration** — `test_git_gate.py` imports
  from the new handler module; `test_bootstrap.py` no longer asserts that
  project initialization ships standalone hook scripts (it no longer does).

### Fixed

- **Settings merge on project update** — `aipass init update` was
  clobbering user hook configurations. The merge logic now layers AIPass
  defaults under existing user settings.
- **Python 3.10 test collision** — a module/function name collision caused
  mock patch targets to fail on Python 3.10. Test targets corrected.
- **Dead code removal** — removed an unused CLI `__main__.py` entrypoint
  and cleaned up `.gitignore` entries that were masking tracked files.
- **Codecov patch threshold** lowered to 50% to reflect the project's
  current coverage baseline and stop false-negative CI failures.

### Removed

- **18 standalone hook scripts** in `.claude/hooks/` disabled (renamed with
  `(disabled)` suffix). Their logic now lives in native handler modules
  under `src/aipass/hooks/apps/handlers/`. The old files remain on disk for
  reference but are no longer executed.
- **`drone hook-sounds` plugin** disabled. Sound control moved to hooks
  branch as `drone @hooks hooksound on|off` with full mute support for
  all 14 handlers (the old plugin only controlled 4).

### Infrastructure

- **Provider manifest migrated to bridge pattern.** `provider_manifest.json`
  now stores bridge commands (`$AIPASS_HOME/...bridges/claude.py EventType`)
  instead of standalone script names. `doctor_wire.py` auto-wires bridge
  entries directly — no longer copies scripts to `~/.claude/hooks/` or
  generates `sys.executable` paths. Doctor checks validate commands exist in
  provider settings instead of checking for script files on disk.
- **README v3** — rewritten for external users. Tighter problem/solution
  framing, collapsible agent details, Gemini CLI removed (untested),
  user-project perspective throughout.
- **Inline handoff** (`aipass init run` Step 11) — new default stays in the
  current terminal via `os.execvp` instead of opening a new window. Users
  choose "stay here" or "new window." Enables single-terminal demo
  recordings. Closes [#610](https://github.com/AIOSAI/AIPass/issues/610).
- **Project-aware global prompt** — the global prompt loader now detects
  whether CWD is inside AIPass or an external project. External projects
  receive their own lighter prompt (from `.aipass/aipass_global_prompt.md`)
  instead of the full AIPass-internal playbook. Fixes `drone @prax` errors
  in new projects.
- **Project CLAUDE.md template** — `aipass init` now generates a
  project-specific CLAUDE.md from `.aipass/project_CLAUDE.md` instead of
  copying the AIPass-internal one. Removes the startup protocol reference
  to `drone @prax dashboard refresh` which doesn't exist in external
  projects.
- **Gemini CLI removed** from `aipass init` CLI choices and handoff
  options. GEMINI.md no longer created for new projects. Gemini CLI is
  being retired upstream.
- **Demo GIF** added to `assets/demo.gif` and referenced in README.
